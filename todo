solid_not isn't working for monsters, need alternative
shader for through walls
traceline to check for spawn needs to be at mins and maxs too i guess?
"can't spawn here" message is too long, put a check in and break it up
can't see survivors (no mdl?)
players still disappearing after certain distance/pvs or something
